The website is to help students seeking admission in NIT Hamirpur, to find there way through procedures and requirements.

The proposed features of website in order of high to low priorities are:
+ To do list : cookie based
+ Document order list(Nested in todo list)
+ All important forms and links
+ An embeded map to show locations
+ FAQ section

The features listed below are good to have and should not be our primary concern:
+ A splash screen cookie based (onetime only) to promote ISTE.
+ ISTE's main site (abouts and history)

To ease the development and maintainence following technologies will be used:
+ **NODE.JS**: To provide modules helpfull in developement. As the site will be static as of now no node features other than npm will be required.

+ **PUG(HTML)**: To easily write and maintain web pages *pug* templating engine provide conveinient way,with python like indentation syntax.

+ **LESS(CSS)**: Extended css with features like inheritance variables improved selectors, completely compatible with traditional css. All of less is compiled down to traditional css files.
